            <h2>Truth and Reconciliation in Education!</h2>
            
            <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) was created through a legal settlement between Residential Schools Survivors, the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit representatives and the parties responsible for creation and operation of the schools: the federal government and the church bodies.</p>
            <p>The TRC’s mandate was to inform all Canadians about what happened in residential schools. The TRC documented the truth of Survivors, their families, communities and anyone personally affected by the residential school experience. This included First Nations, Inuit and Métis former residential school students, their families, communities, the churches, former school employees, government officials and other Canadians.</p>
            <p>The TRC concluded its mandate in 2015 and transferred its records to the safekeeping of National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR).</p>
                <p>Part of the mandate of the NCTR is to raise awareness of history and creation of the residential school system, its ongoing legacy, and how it has shaped the country we live in today. The NCTR website hosts teaching resources, organized by grade level, for preschool to adult level learners. Check out the teaching resources from the

            <ul>
                <li>In B.C's redesigned curriculum, Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integrated throughout all areas of learning and are evident in the curriculum's rationale statements, goals, big ideas, mandated learning standards, and elaborations.</li>
                <li>The First Peoples Princples of Learning (FPPL) is the learning philosophy underpinning British Columbia's redesigned curriculum </li><li>The FPPL offers a crucial lens for curriculum, placing a significant importance on the authentic integration of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in relevant and meaningful ways.</li>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The changes being made at the government level provides an opportunity for communication, and the sharing of ideas, on a personal and societal level. It is up to individual schools and eduators to ensure the changes to curriculum, are upheld in their schools and districts.<br> To learn more about how the Government of Canada is responsding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action regarding education follow the link to their webpage.</p>

<h2>Orange Shirt Day</h2>
<div class="container2">
<p>Orange Shirt Day/National Day of Truth and Reconciliation is celebrated on September 30th every year. This day is to honour the survivors of residential schools, and acknowledge the profound impact these institutions had on Indigenous communities and people.<br>According to the Orange Shirt Day Society, Orange Shirt Day is a legacy of the St. Joseph Mission Residential School (1891-1981) Commemoration Project and Reunion events that took place in Williams Lake, BC, Canada, in May 2013.<br>At that inagural event, former student Phyllis (Jack) Webstad told her story of her first day at residential school in 1973 when her shiny new orange shirt, bought by her grandmother, was taken from her as a six-year old girl.

<p>Jo Chrona is a well know author and educator from Kitsumkalum First Nation. In her book <em>Wayi Wah!  Indigenous Pedagogies An Act for Reconciliation and Anti-Racist Education,</em>  Chrona reminds readers, "making mistakes and learning from them so that we can do better next time is integral to understand in our classrooms."</p>
            <p>When thinking about reconciliation, Chrona (2022) states, "we are not yet where we need to be, but change is slowly happening in British Columbia. Because of a number of factors, the province is gradually seeing over-all reductions in the disparity in education outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners, and the education system is learning to respond to the voices of Indigenous Peoples (Augustine et al., 2018). Importantly, this work is happening in ways that recognize that the system needed to change to better meet the needs of all learners (rather than vice versa).</p>
