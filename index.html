            <h2>Truth and Reconciliation in Education!</h2>
            <p>Jo Chrona is a well know author and educator from Kitsumkalum First Nation. In her book <em>Wayi Wah!

Because of a number of factors, the province is gradually seeing over-all reductions in the disparity in education outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners, and the education system is learning to respond to the voices of Indigenous Peoples (Augustine et al., 2018).
