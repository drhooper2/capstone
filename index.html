            <p>Some things that are happening in British Columbia education since the Calls to Action were created in June 2015:
            <ul>
                <li>In B.C's redesigned curriculum, Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integrated throughout all areas of learning and are evident in the curriculum's rationale statements, goals, big ideas, mandated learning standards, and elaborations.</li>
                <li>The First Peoples Princples of Learning (FPPL) is the learning philosophy underpinning British Columbia's redesigned curriculum https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1245319.pdf</li><li>The FPPL offers a crucial lens for curriculum, placing a significant importance on the authentic integration of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in relevant and meaningful ways.</li>
            </ul>
